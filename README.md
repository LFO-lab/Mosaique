Mosaïque is a corpus-based concatenative synthesis software that offers an immersive graphical representation to creators who wish to manipulate sound within a virtual timbral space. Mosaïque takes the form of a collection of Max for Live instruments to play sound coming from the Ableton Live composition environment. In developing Mosaïque, we aim to provide greater accessibility to a sound generation technique that is relatively new and still not widely spread. The technique involves mapping thousands of short sound samples (the corpus) into a three-dimensional representation based on their timbral proximity; the similarity of sounds will correspond to their respective proximity to each other in the 3D space.

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
In order to use _Mosaïque_ you need :
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.ableton.com/en/live/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ableton Live 11 or 12</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://cycling74.com/products/max" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Max 8.6.0 or later</a></li>
</ul>

To work properly, 

If you have **Ableton Live 11**, we recommend that you install a separate Max version that is at least version 8.6.0 and define the application as the default Max in your Ableton preferences <br>

Mosaïque has not been tested on **Ableton Live 10**, but it might well work. Again, just make sure your Max version is at least 8.6.0.

<h2>Install</h2>
Mosaïque works as both a Max for Live device AND a Max patch.
